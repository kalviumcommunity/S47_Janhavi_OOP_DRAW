# Art Exhibition Gallery

## Overview

The Art Exhibition Gallery project is a Java-based simulation that models an art gallery where users can manage artworks. This project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, the `this` pointer, and arrays of objects.

## Features

1. **Create Artworks**: Define artworks with a title, artist, and year of creation.
2. **Add Artworks to Gallery**: Store artworks in a gallery with a fixed capacity.
3. **List Artworks**: Display all artworks in the gallery.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Classes and Objects

- Defined `Artwork` and `Gallery` classes.
- Created `Artwork` objects and demonstrated basic functionality.

### Milestone 2: Using the `this` Pointer

- Introduced the `this` pointer in the `Artwork` class to refer to instance variables.

### Milestone 3: Array of Objects

- Added an array of `Artwork` objects in the `Gallery` class.
- Implemented methods to add and list artworks in the gallery.
